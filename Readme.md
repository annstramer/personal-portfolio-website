A frontend portfolio built to present engineering work shaped by a background in motion, interaction design, and system-level thinking.

Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site reflects a deliberate choice: clarity over abstraction, control over complexity, and performance through restraint.


## Overview

This portfolio represents a transition from early interactive motion systems to modern frontend engineering focused on architecture, authentication flows, and data-driven interfaces.

The site is intentionally lightweight. Rather than relying on a framework, it uses semantic HTML, modular CSS, and structured JavaScript to maintain transparency in how each interaction is constructed.

The goal is not visual noise, but meaningful interaction.


## Design & Interaction Philosophy

My work integrates motion as part of interface meaning, not decoration. Animation supports hierarchy, guides attention, and clarifies state transitions.

Across the site you’ll find:

* Structured content flow
* Intentional pacing of interaction
* Performance-aware animation
* Clear separation between layout, logic, and presentation

The motion and visual section highlights earlier large-scale interactive systems. Those projects inform how I think about frontend architecture today: systems must scale visually as well as technically.


## Technical Approach

* Semantic HTML structure
* Modular CSS organization
* Vanilla JavaScript for interaction logic
* Dynamic rendering for project collections
* Responsive layout patterns
* Performance-conscious asset handling

Choosing a minimal stack reinforces architectural clarity and keeps the focus on system behavior rather than tooling.


## Featured Work

* Frontend applications using modern JavaScript and React
* Data-driven interfaces with controlled state management
* Legacy motion systems and interactive case studies


## Deployment

Deployed via Vercel for fast, reliable global delivery.


## Ongoing Direction

This portfolio is intentionally iterative. Future expansions may include deeper architectural abstraction and additional case studies as systems grow in complexity.
